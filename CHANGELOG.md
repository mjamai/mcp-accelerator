  - `@mcp-accelerator/middleware-resilience`: **91.04% coverage** (Circuit Breaker, Timeout)
- **Core package coverage**: 96.65% statements, 75.94% branches, 98.11% functions, 97.07% lines
- **Source code average**: 85%+ statements across all middleware packages
- Added Jest configuration for middleware-cors package
- Excluded compiled dist/ files from coverage reports

### Added
- **Security Packages** üîí
  - `@mcp-accelerator/middleware-auth`: JWT & API Key authentication
  - `@mcp-accelerator/middleware-ratelimit`: Rate limiting & quotas (in-memory + Redis)
  - `@mcp-accelerator/middleware-cors`: CORS configuration helpers
- Secure API example demonstrating production-grade security patterns
- `SECURITY_PACKAGES.md`: Comprehensive security guide
- Support for layered security architecture (auth + rate limiting + authorization)

### Documentation
- **All documentation translated to English** (code comments, guides, READMEs)
- Added security best practices guide
- Updated README with security packages section
- Created secure-api example with complete documentation
- Created `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing documentation
- Created `TYPESCRIPT_ERGONOMICS.md` for type usage guide

### Observability
- **New Package**: `@mcp-accelerator/middleware-observability` with OpenTelemetry
- Added 3 new lifecycle hook phases: `OnError`, `OnRequest`, `OnResponse`
- Enhanced `HookContext` with observability fields (duration, startTime, error, etc.)
- Full distributed tracing support (Jaeger, Zipkin, OTLP)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus, OTLP)
- Structured logging with OpenTelemetry
- Zero-config presets for dev/prod/self-hosted

### Testing & CI/CD
- Fixed Jest configuration for monorepo (multi-project setup)
- Added 47 unit tests (core + middleware resilience)
- Achieved 70% test coverage
- Created GitHub Actions CI pipeline:
  - Tests on Node 18.x, 20.x, 21.x
  - Linting and type-checking
  - Security audits (npm audit, Snyk)
  - Coverage reporting (Codecov)
- Created GitHub Actions publish pipeline (automated npm publishing)
- Added test scripts: `test`, `test:watch`, `test:ci`
- Created `TESTING_GUIDE.md` with best practices
- Coverage badges in README

### TypeScript Ergonomics
- Improved type safety across the entire API
- Replaced `Record<string, unknown>` with typed `Metadata` and `StrictMetadata`
- Added generic types to `Tool<TInput, TOutput>`
- Added generic types to `MCPMessage<TParams, TResult>`
- Created specialized message types: `MCPRequest`, `MCPResponse`, `MCPEvent`
- Added generic types to `Middleware<TMetadata>` and `HookContext<TData, TMetadata>`
- Created helper types: `InferToolInput`, `InferToolOutput`, `TypedTool`, `TypedMiddleware`
- Removed `any` from example plugins
- Full IntelliSense support for metadata fields
- Type-safe context in all handlers

### Resilience & Production-Ready Transports
- **New Package**: `@mcp-accelerator/middleware-resilience`
  - Circuit Breaker pattern
  - Timeout with per-tool configuration
  - Retry with exponential backoff
  - Bulkhead (concurrency limiting)
- **Enhanced HTTP Transport**:
  - Request/connection/keep-alive timeouts
  - Body size limits (1MB default)
  - Concurrency control with queue management
  - Backpressure protection
  - Circuit breaker support
  - Health & metrics endpoints
- **Enhanced WebSocket Transport**:
  - Heartbeat/ping-pong mechanism
  - Idle timeout detection
  - Per-client rate limiting
  - Message size limits
  - Backpressure control (high water mark)
  - Connection capacity limits
  - Automatic cleanup of zombie connections

### Added
- Initial modular monorepo architecture
- Split into 5 packages: core + 4 transports
- HookPhase enum for type-safe lifecycle hooks

## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-08
